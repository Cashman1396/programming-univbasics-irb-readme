## Introduction

So, we're ready to have a conversation with Ruby. We can't very well open up a
computer and start talking to it.

Instead, we run a program that's a "conversation room." In it we send _expressions_ for
Ruby to _evaluate_. After Ruby evaluates the _expression_, it will send back
_return values_, or responses.

## Define IRB

IRB stands for "Interactive Ruby." It's a like a room especially built for
having conversations with Ruby. We can think of it as your Ruby playground.
IRB is run from within your computer's terminal by typing `irb`. Once IRB is
running, we key in Ruby _expressions_ and hit ENTER. Afterward we'll see Ruby's
evaluation of the _expression_ (the _return value_).

Programs like IRB are known as "REPLs." "REPL" stands for _Read–Evaluate–Print
Loop_. Many languages feature REPLs: Python, Ruby, Lisp and others. We'll talk
more about REPLs in the next section.

## Identify REPLs

REPL stands for read–eval–print loop.

If you think about it, that's what you do when you're being the listener in a
conversation.

You:

1. "read" in the other person's expression ("I'm curious about learning programming!")
2. "evaluate" what the expression means ("My friend is bored at their job? My friend wants to make more money?)
3. "print" your reponse ("Oh great!" "I love programming, you're going to love it too!").

IRB, as a REPL, gives you a place where:

1. _You_ type in a Ruby expression (which IRB "reads")
2. _IRB_ "evaluates" the expression based on the rules of Ruby
3. _IRB_ "prints" a response or a _return value_

## Explain why REPLs are useful

Sometimes we want to see how code works. Instead of having to build a brand new
program (in a file), load up all the libraries, blah, blah, blah, IRB is a
quick "laboratory" where we can see how something works. This is usually better
than looking at the docs or writing a Stack Overflow post. With just a simple
bit of test data we can _verify_ we understand how a line of code is working.

Think about a car: it's a complex machine with many interacting parts. But if
your car won't start you might "isolate" the battery and hook it up to a
battery tester. If the battery tester shows the battery is good, then you know
that the problem is somewhere else; if the battery is dead, then you have
_verified_ that the battery is the problem with your car.

That process is known as _debugging_ when applied to computers or
_troubleshooting_ when applied to pretty much everything else. At the risk of
sounding mystical, debugging is a skill shared by all makers: guitarists to
brewers, to chefs, to programmers. From Neal Stephenson's _Cryptonomicon_:

> Randy counts four men in addition to Amy and the pilot...  All of them are
> fiddling around with engines or diving gear in a way Randy recognizes,
> through many cultural and technological barriers, as debugging.

## Access and Exit IRB Via Your Terminal

To access IRB, just type `irb` in the terminal. Let's start by typing a few
_expressions_ into IRB and see the read-evaluate-print-loop for ourselves.

### Instructions

1. Open up a terminal. You can launch the Learn Sandbox and use the terminal at
   the bottom.

2. Type `irb` and hit `return`

3. Now that you've started IRB, type the commands below to see how it works!
   Type each of the following lines into the IRB shell and press enter.

- `Time.now`
- `255 / 5`
- `9 ** 2`
- `puts "hello world"`

To leave IRB, type the `exit` command - this will get you back to your command line.

### Session Example

### Reflecting on Conversation

Congratulations! You've had a conversation with Ruby! Ruby is a good
conversationalist and waits for you to issue an _expression_. Ruby _evaluates_
this expression and returns its interpretation of your expression: a _response_
or _return value_.

For `Time.now`, Ruby looks at your computer's clock and _returns_ the time. For
`255 / 5` it evaluates your expression's use of the division _operator_ (more
on them later) and does some mathematics to produce `51`. Similarly, the `**`
means "use what comes after me as an exponent to what's in front of me" and
returns `81` (it's the same as 9<sup>2</sup>).  Lastly, the `puts`
expression means "print something, in this case, `hello world`.

### Typographical Conventions

#### Showing Return Value

As you saw in that last section, it was kind of annoying to read the return
values as separated from their _expression_. By convention, Rubyists sometimes
document a return value _next to_ an expression as separated by `#=>`.

The `#` in Ruby is a comment character and everything after it is ignored. The
`#=>` is simply a tool to help you "imagine" what IRB might do with the
expression.

Ruby documentation would frequently look like:

- `Time.now #=> 2019-03-26 14:00:27 -0400`
- `255 / 5 #=> 51`
- `9 ** 2 #=> 81`
- `puts "hello world" #=> nil`

> **NOTE**: That `puts` returns `nil` is a very interesting and mildly strange
> thing to see, but it's true. We'll talk all about it later.

If you wanted to put one of these examples in IRB, you'd copy up to the `#=>`
but _not_ include it (or anything after it until the end of the line).

#### Ofsetting Code

Whenever we're writing a word of Ruby code or a value that Ruby returns we put
it in `this typeface`. So while "9 times 9 is 81", `9 * 9 #=> 81`. This
convention should make code things "pop out" for your eye.

## Conclusion

As we get into more complex code, sometimes we need a quick scratch pad to work
in to test a bit of code out. IRB is great for this purpose. We can use it to
learn about unfamiliar keywords, calculate equations, and, in general, become
more comfortable writing in Ruby.
